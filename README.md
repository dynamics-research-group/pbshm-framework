# PBSHM Framework
The PBSHM Framework is a preconfigured version of the [PBSHM Core](https://github.com/dynamics-research-group/pbshm-flask-core) and module ecosystem. The goal of the PBSHM Core, was to build a base application which facilitated the curation of PBSHM Modules which intern consume [PBSHM Schema](https://github.com/dynamics-research-group/pbshm-schema) data. The purpose of the PBSHM Framework is to provide a single packaged product of the [PBSHM Schema](https://github.com/dynamics-research-group/pbshm-schema), [PBSHM Core](https://github.com/dynamics-research-group/pbshm-flask-core), and any relevant PBSHM Modules: to showcase the available technology in an easy to use manner and enable anyone, regardless of their coding knowledge, to interact with the aforementioned technology.

For more information on the PBSHM Core, please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dynamics-research-group/pbshm-flask-core). Each module included within the PBSHM Framework is linked [below](#included-modules), with details of the module authors and any further information on how to use the module. For more information on how to create a module for PBSHM Core, please see the [module template](https://github.com/dynamics-research-group/pbshm-module-template) repository.

The minimum version of Python required to run the PBSHM Core is version 3.9.18.

## Installation
Install the package via pip:
```
pip install pbshm-framework
```

## Setup
Set the Flask application path and environment.

For Linux/Mac:
```
export FLASK_APP=pbshm
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

For Windows:
```
set FLASK_APP=pbshm
set FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

Configure settings and initialise the database with a new root user:
```
flask init config
flask init db new-root-user
```
The above steps will prompt you for all the required fields to set up the system.

## Running
The application is run via the standard Flask command:
```
flask run
```
